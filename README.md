🌱 I embarked on this journey roughly 6 months ago, and I've been passionately exploring front-end technologies ever since. My goal is to build a solid foundation and become a proficient developer in this exciting field.

🛠️ While I'm still in the early stages of my career, I've been actively working on personal projects and experimenting with various technologies. My GitHub is a reflection of my dedication to improving my skills.
